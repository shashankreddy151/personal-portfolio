# Intro

I am a graduate student at the [New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)](https://ds.njit.edu/ms-data-science), holding a Master's degree in Data Science. With a strong interest in machine learning and deep learning, I am dedicated to exploring innovative ways to leverage neural networks for model training. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in data analysis, algorithm development, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence. 

In addition to my studies, I enjoy collaborating on projects that involve real-world data challenges, and I am eager to contribute to advancements in technology that have a meaningful impact on society. 


# Some History

- At 8, growing up in a village, my tech access was like a rare Pokémon—hard to find! I could only hit the school computer once a week. But hey, necessity is the mother of invention, right? I often found myself dismantling electronic toys to see what made them tick. Spoiler alert: most of them didn't tick after that!

- At 20, I finally snagged my first computer while studying Electronics and Communication Engineering. Picture me with a wide grin, exploring my shiny new machine! My cousin, a tech wizard, helped me pick the right one and introduced me to various operating systems. I dived headfirst into Linux and Ubuntu, navigating the terminal like I was on a treasure hunt. Pro tip: Don't forget to document every command—turns out, some treasures are hard to find again!

- At 21, I began my Bachelor’s degree at [Sreyas Institute of Engineering and Technology](https://sreyas.ac.in/), initially struggling with a GPA that felt more like a plateau than a stepping stone. However, everything changed when I discovered my passion for coding, thanks to a supportive professor who inspired me to dive into algorithms and Arduino projects. With newfound enthusiasm, I transformed my academic experience from “meh” to “wow!” and I began to improve my grades while enthusiastically sharing my projects, much like an artist proudly displaying their work in a gallery.

- At 22, I was a Student Intern at [Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL)](https://www.ecil.co.in/), where I led the development of an AI-powered traffic management system in Hyderabad. We managed to boost traffic flow by 20%—which felt like turning a chaotic rush hour into a stroll through the park! I implemented computer vision techniques to detect vehicle density, giving our system some serious “see-through” powers. Plus, I used reinforcement learning to adjust signal timings, ensuring drivers weren’t just playing “red light, green light.” Collaborating with my amazing team, we deployed the solution using OpenCV and Python, proving that tech can help us beat the traffic game. After all, who doesn’t want to play the role of a digital traffic cop?

- At 23, the pandemic was like a surprise pop quiz—stressful, unpredictable, and a little too real. As classes moved online, I became best buddies with Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. I learned cloud technologies and realized that even in chaos, there were opportunities to grow. I may have completed my Bachelor’s during a pandemic, but I came out stronger, like a phoenix rising from the ashes—or a student who finally figured out how to make the perfect cup of instant noodles!

- At 24, I jumped into the job market, applying for various positions but faced a string of rejections that tested my resolve. After a tough start, I took my first shot at getting a U.S. visa in Mumbai—but on June 7th, I faced disappointment when my application was rejected. Undeterred, I kept applying for jobs and eventually set my sights on a Networking Engineer role at Amazon. I managed to clear two technical rounds, but by the time I received their response, I had already secured a second chance for my visa. just when I thought my dreams of coming to the U.S. were slipping away, fate smiled upon me! I passed another interview, and the following week, a golden visa slot appeared. I hopped on a flight to Delhi, accompanied by my trusty friends for moral support (and good company). On August 26th, I successfully obtained my visa and flew to the U.S. on September 4th. My first big splurge? A $6 luggage cart at the airport. Talk about starting off on a high note!

- At 25, I embarked on my first semester in a Master’s in Data Science at [New Jersey Institute of Technology](https://www.njit.edu/), diving headfirst into algorithms and data analytics. Classes began on September 6th, and talk about culture shock! The U.S. education system was a wild ride—no more sitting in the same class all day with the same professors. I suddenly had the freedom to choose my classes and professors. While the first semester was a bit rocky—like trying to navigate a maze blindfolded—I managed to find my way through. In my first semester, in Data Analytics with R programming language, my professor introduced us to Kaggle competitions and assigned us the Digit Recognizer project. I learned about neural networks and trained one from scratch, finishing in the top 20 of that competition. That was my first achievement in my Master’s!

- By 26, I was hitting my stride in my second semester. Thanks to Professor Matt Toegel, who introduced me to GitHub, I became a documentation enthusiast. He taught me that documenting my projects was as vital as my caffeine intake during finals week. My GitHub transformed into a digital scrapbook filled with my projects and code snippets—proof that I had been busy, even when Netflix tried to distract me! I graduated with my Master’s in Data Science in December 2023, proudly flaunting a CGPA of 3.33. Not too shabby for a kid who started with an average GPA! With my degree in hand, I shifted my focus to job hunting, zeroing in on opportunities in machine learning engineering and deep learning. As I stepped into the professional world, my commitment to lifelong learning remained strong. I continued to stay updated with the latest in AI and machine learning, documenting everything on GitHub, sharing knowledge, and collaborating with others. Because at the end of the day, learning is a journey, and I was ready for the next adventure!

# Travel / Geography

- I was born in Hyderabad, Telangana, India, a city rich in history, culture, and vibrant traditions. Known as the “City of Pearls,” Hyderabad blends its royal heritage with modern development. The city is famous for its iconic landmarks like the Charminar and Golkonda Fort, and it's also home to delicious cuisine, especially the world-renowned Hyderabadi biryani. Additionally, Hyderabad has established itself as a major IT hub, with HITEC City symbolizing its modern economic growth.

- I spent my childhood in a small village in Telangana, surrounded by lush greenery and the soothing sounds of nature. Growing up in a rural setting, I developed a deep appreciation for nature and simplicity, which shaped my outlook on life.

- I’ve traveled to various places across India, experiencing the vibrant energy of Mumbai, the historical richness of Delhi, and the coastal beauty of Goa and Kerala. I’ve also explored the southernmost tip of India in Kanyakumari, the scenic beaches of Visakhapatnam (Vizag), and the unique charm of smaller towns like Bhimavaram. Each destination has offered me a glimpse into the diverse landscapes, cultures, and traditions that make India so extraordinary. These journeys have enriched my perspective and deepened my connection with the vast and vibrant tapestry of India.
